# 👋 Hi, I’m Erik Holmes

I’m a mathematician (PhD, algebraic number theory) transitioning into Machine Learning, with a growing focus on **AI interpretability**, **agentic models**, and **LLMs**. I love projects that combine mathematical insight with real-world impact, and I’m particularly excited about the frontier of safe and understandable AI systems.

- 🔭 Currently working through foundational ML projects like [micrograd](https://github.com/eriktholmes/Zero-to-hero-course/tree/main/episode-1/micrograd) and building toward applied interpretability research
- 📚 Long-term ML/AI research interests: interpretability, alignment, and AI safety
- ✍️ Also working on varous [research projects](https://erikholmesmath.com/research.htm) in number theory: many related to geometric properties of lattices and the corresponding distributions.
- 🎥 Fun fact: I used to work in video production while in grad school and still love storytelling through visuals

## 📌 Featured Repositories

### [`Zero-to-hero-course`](https://github.com/eriktholmes/Zero-to-hero-course)
A structured walkthrough of Andrej Karpathy’s Zero to Hero YouTube series. Includes:
- A from-scratch build of [micrograd](https://github.com/eriktholmes/Zero-to-hero-course/tree/main/episode-1/micrograd)
- Experiments on custom activations, visualization of gradient flows, and interpretability at the neuron level
- Exploratory blog-style notes and diagrams (with more to come!)

### [`Math_things`](https://github.com/eriktholmes/math_things)
A catch-all for math-related code, currently focused on:
- Computational experiments related to unit lattices in number fields
- Visualization of rank 2 shapes within the [fundamental domain](/Math_things/unit_shapes/FD_domain.png)
- Ongoing research on lattice shapes and Galois module structure
