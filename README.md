# 👋 Hi, I’m Erik

I am a postdoctoral fellow in number theory/arithmetic statistics and am transitioning into industry. As a mathematician I have always been drawn to computational exploration and have used Python throughout my research to generate, analyze and visualize data, and more generally to build intuition around abstract mathematical objects. The more coding/computation that I am exposed to the more I seem to enjoy it and that is one of the many reasons for this transition. 

My current focus is on machine learning where-with the rapid growth of AI-I find myself thinking often about safety and the potential impacts on society. As such, I am increasingly interested in **interpretability** and **alignment** though I am certainly in an exploratory phase. Ultimately, I would love to contribute to safe, understandable AI systems and to apply my research experience in pure math to problems that have an immediate impact. 

### Current work/goals:
- 📚 Working on building a solid foundation through ML projects and courses, for example projects like [micrograd](https://github.com/eriktholmes/Zero-to-hero-course/tree/main/episode-1/micrograd) and building towards applied interpretability research.
- 📈 Long-term learning goals/research interests: interpretability, alignment, and AI safety
- ✍️ Also working on various [research projects](https://erikholmesmath.com/research.htm) related to the *geometry of lattices* in number theory and their distributions.

#### 🎥 Fun fact: I worked in video production while in grad school and absolutely love good visual storytellers



## 📌 Featured Repositories

### [`Zero-to-hero-course`](https://github.com/eriktholmes/Zero-to-hero-course)
A structured walkthrough of Andrej Karpathy’s Zero to Hero YouTube series. Includes:
- A from-scratch build of [micrograd](https://github.com/eriktholmes/Zero-to-hero-course/tree/main/episode-1/micrograd)
- Experiments on custom activations, visualization of gradient flows, and interpretability at the neuron level
- Exploratory blog-style notes and diagrams (with more to come!)
- In progress **makemore**, working to implement the bigram example next.

### [`Math_things`](https://github.com/eriktholmes/math_things)
A catch-all for math-related code, currently focused on:
- Computational experiments related to unit lattices in number fields
- Visualization of rank 2 shapes within the [fundamental domain](/Math_things/unit_shapes/FD_domain.png)
- Ongoing research on lattices and questions of distribution
- Ultimately, I am excited about a possible application of lattice shapes to log terms in Malle's conjecture (roughly about the asymptotics of specialized counting functions)
